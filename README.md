## Overview

The **Arbitrage Bot** is an automated trading system designed to identify and execute arbitrage opportunities across decentralized exchanges (DEXes). It continuously scans price discrepancies between different DEXes, executes trades to exploit these differences, and profits from the price spread. The bot is built using **Rust** for performance and reliability, and it interacts with the Ethereum blockchain to perform transactions.



## Objective

The primary goal of the arbitrage bot is to:

- Identify price inefficiencies between DEXes such as **Uniswap**, **Sushiswap**, and **Balancer**.
- Execute arbitrage trades to capture profit without holding positions for extended periods, minimizing risk exposure.
- Optimize gas fees and transaction execution to ensure profitability.



## Features

- **Cross-DEX Arbitrage**: The bot compares token prices across multiple decentralized exchanges.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: It monitors liquidity pools, order books, and market movements in real-time.
- **Automated Execution**: Once an arbitrage opportunity is detected, the bot automatically executes the necessary buy/sell trades.
- **Gas Optimization**: The bot uses gas-efficient strategies to minimize transaction costs and maximize profits.
- **Modular Design**: Built in a modular way, allowing easy integration with new exchanges and strategies.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Development (In Progress)

- [x] **DEX Integration**: Support for Uniswap v2 in ethereum, fetch target transactions and decode
- [ ] **Basic Arbitrage Logic**: Identify and execute basic arbitrage opportunities based on price discrepancies.
- [ ] **Gas Estimation and Optimization**: Include functionality to estimate gas usage and ensure profitable execution.

### Phase 2: Improvements and Enhancements (Planned)

- [ ] **Advanced Arbitrage Strategies**: Implement triangular arbitrage and more complex strategies.
- [ ] **More DEX Integrations**: Expand support for more decentralized exchanges (Uniswap v3, Sushiswap, and Balancer, etc.).
- [ ] **Slippage Control**: Add dynamic slippage calculation to reduce risk in volatile markets.

### Phase 3: Optimization and Scaling (Planned)

- [ ] **Multi-Chain Support**: Extend the bot to work on other blockchains like BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche.
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Improve performance by enabling parallel transaction execution for faster arbitrage capture.
- [ ] **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML algorithms to predict market inefficiencies and improve arbitrage efficiency.
